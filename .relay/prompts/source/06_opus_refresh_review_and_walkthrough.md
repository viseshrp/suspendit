## Skill Handling Rule

Use only this prompt's explicitly linked skills.

Fetch and read each linked skill and required companion completely from its GitHub URL before use. Follow the linked procedures directly; do not depend on local skill repositories, installed slash commands, or earlier prompt text.

The prompt is the contract. The locked task artifact is the contract for execution. Skills are supporting procedures only.

If a skill conflicts with this prompt, this prompt wins.

If a conflict is material, stop and ask instead of silently choosing.

Do not use any skill to expand scope, add architecture changes, add tests, add unrelated refactors, or override my explicit instructions.

`no-ai-slop` is mandatory for every Markdown document this phase creates or revises. Treat it as the ultimate writing guide and final authority for prose and presentation after satisfying this prompt's factual, technical, structural, and output requirements. If another skill or instruction conflicts only on writing style, `no-ai-slop` wins; this prompt and locked task artifacts still control scope, meaning, required structure, artifact names, constraints, and evidence.

Apply `no-ai-slop` while drafting and run its `eval.md` self-check before saving each Markdown artifact or sending the final response. If its `SKILL.md` or `eval.md` cannot be read and applied, stop before creating or revising Markdown and report the blocker. Ignore its draft-request, detection-mode, and mandatory `What changed` workflow unless this prompt explicitly asks for them.


## Engineering Contract

Apply this contract during planning, execution, review, and review fixes.

### Plan adherence

- If there is a plan, and only when a plan is provided by me explicitly, follow the plan exactly.
- No divergence.
- No creativity.
- No architecture changes.
- Just execute what is written.
- If the plan, code reality, or user request conflicts with another instruction, stop and ask.
- If you have questions, cannot make a decision, do not have enough context, or hit conflicts, DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. STOP. ASK. GET CONFIRMATION. THEN PROCEED.

### Scope control

- Do not change, refactor, or reorganize unrelated code unless absolutely necessary.
- Put suggestions to improve surrounding code in a separate “Not Doing / Suggestions” section; do not implement them.
- Ignore DevOps, packaging, building, and test-related work unless otherwise specified in the plan or prompt.
- Keep UI changes within UI code unless the plan explicitly requires changes elsewhere.
- Match existing style guidelines.
- Do not write the changelog.

### Performance and complexity

- No time-based waiting hacks.
- No hacky retry loops.
- Check algorithmic time and space complexity.
- Use the best solution after weighing options.
- Do not choose brute-force methods or quadratic operations unless the plan explicitly justifies them and the data size makes them safe.
- Write readable code.
- Prefer readable code over overcomplicated performance or time-complexity optimizations.
- If a change I request reduces performance, stop and tell me before implementing it.
- Explain performance concerns in enough detail for a junior developer to understand.

### Dependencies, frameworks, and documentation grounding

- No third-party libraries without explicit approval.
- If a third-party library is approved, verify library/framework usage against the correct documentation; ground 100% of usage in those docs.
- Always ground development work involving libraries 100% in documentation with zero assumptions.
- If documentation is poor and the library is open source, find its source code, clone it in a temporary folder, and read it thoroughly to supplement the documentation.
- Ensure usage follows the latest APIs.
- Flag outdated APIs.
- Check that library/framework usage is necessary and justified.

### Public APIs and exceptions

- Backwards compatibility is top priority.
- Changes in user-facing APIs must be backwards compatible, unless the app version is unreleased.
- If a third-party library is used in a public-facing API, the user should never see library/framework-specific exceptions raised.
- Use custom errors/exception classes instead. Reuse existing classes in the codebase or create custom ones if needed.
- Do not chain exceptions when doing so would expose implementation/library details to users.
- If logging is used and available, log the trace with the logger for debugging.
- If changes touch public APIs or add new public APIs, ensure they are user-friendly, intuitive, blend well with the existing public API set, and have appropriate names.

### Code quality and maintainability

- Use the target language and its standard library idiomatically.
- Reuse existing code wherever possible.
- Keep code DRY.
- Follow separation of concerns.
- Follow the single responsibility principle.
- Use proper imports.
- Do not load files as blobs and execute the code within another block of code.
- Use assert statements only in test files, never in production code.
- Surface all assumptions.
- If changes reinvent or duplicate something already in the source code, stop and flag it.
- Do not hardcode numbers, versions, or other constants. Reuse existing constants, or create new constants in the right places and reuse them appropriately.

### Types

- When adding types, use correct ones.
- Keep type declarations and annotations proportionate and readable. Do not use deeply nested, repetitive, or unnecessarily complex annotations that crowd code or obscure intent; prefer the simplest accurate type or a well-named type alias when that is clearer.
- Do not use filler types.
- Do not use overly generic types just to satisfy a checker.
- Do not use type-ignore comments to pass CI temporarily.
- Do not use `typing.Cast` or other casts merely to satisfy type checkers.

### Python

Apply this subsection only when the target repository uses Python.

The following typing coverage is a hard requirement:

- Every parameter, including `*args` and `**kwargs`, and return value of an added or changed function or method must have an explicit, accurate type hint. Treat `self` and `cls` as implicit; do not annotate them solely for this requirement.
- Every added or changed class variable, class attribute, instance attribute, and module-level mutable or optional state must have an explicit, accurate type hint. A trivial immutable module constant may remain inferred unless the configured type checker needs an annotation.
- Declare instance-attribute types at class scope where feasible; do not add `self.attribute: Type` annotations inside a method merely to satisfy this requirement.
- Do not type annotate local variables inside function or method bodies. Rely on inference; add a local annotation only to resolve a real configured type-checker error.
- Keep required annotations simple and accurate. Do not add advanced type constructs or type-only refactors unless the configured type checker requires them.

### Comments and documentation

- Document every added or changed string transformation with concrete examples showing representative input and expected output.
- Always add brief, detailed comments where they help readers understand the code with little effort.
- Comments must help readers understand the code with little effort.
- Comments must address the code itself, not be meta commentary about the task.
- Cleaning up stale comments is encouraged.
- Ensure every non-obvious change has an explanatory comment.
- Avoid bloated comment blocks. Include enough detail for junior engineers to understand easily.
- Always update related documentation.
- Find the correct docs folder by tracing GitHub Actions workflows, Makefiles, or other docs-build configuration.
- Append to the appropriate sections, or create new ones if required.
- Do not write the changelog.

### Documentation checkpoint

- Complete a documentation checkpoint at every planning, implementation, review, verification, and handoff stage.
- Before a checkpoint can pass, identify the user-, operator-, API-, configuration-, or developer-facing documentation affected by the planned or changed behavior.
- Require the exact durable documentation files/sections, their in-change-set update, and applicable docs build, link check, rendering check, or focused validation; if no durable documentation change is needed, require an evidence-based `Not applicable` decision.
- Code comments, commit messages, and workflow artifacts do not substitute for durable documentation. Do not write the changelog unless explicitly requested.

### Cross-platform behavior

- All changes must be strictly cross-platform and must work on both Linux and Windows.
- Mac is not a concern.

### Git and verification

- Commit often in small increments when committing is allowed.
- Split large commits into sensible parts.
- Add detailed commit messages.
- Explain the work in commit descriptions with as much detail as needed; no length limit.
- Do not claim work is complete without fresh verification evidence.
- Run linter and smoke test if any on every commit, unless the prompt explicitly forbids command execution.
- If a command fails, paste the exact error/log back. Never paraphrase logs.

### Tests

- Do not create, modify, or delete tests while refreshing review artifacts.
- Run only focused existing tests or checks needed to support the refreshed review; do not manually run the entire suite.
- Review tests for the smallest nonduplicative behavior-focused set, one clear behavior per test, small readable functions and helpers, existing test-framework fixtures and native APIs instead of hand-rolled test infrastructure, limited boundary mocking, deterministic isolation, and at least 85% coverage for new or changed lines.
- Flag implementation coupling, patching or mocking the subject under test itself, unscoped global-state mutation, fragile message or layout assertions, mirrored production logic, and coverage-only tests.
- Defer new test authoring and the detailed test-framework-specific contract to the dedicated model-agnostic `09_write_focused_tests_any_model.md` phase.

#### Python / pytest

- When relevant tests use pytest, review them against the repository's existing pytest fixtures and native APIs rather than hand-rolled Python or standard-library mechanisms.

## Prompt

Role:

- You are Claude Opus refreshing the final review artifacts after the AI review/fix loop is complete.
- Read before answering. Do not speculate about files or code you have not inspected.

Task:

- update the review and walkthrough documents to reflect the final code state accurately,
- confirm that every material changed behavior has a completed documentation checkpoint before final human review,
- preserve the existing review trail while clearly marking what was fixed during the review loop.

Artifact location rule:

- `REVIEW.md`, `WALKTHROUGH.md`, and any other workflow-generated Markdown artifacts must stay in the target repo root using their exact required filenames,
- every workflow-generated Markdown artifact must include `Created by`, `Created at`, and `Updated at` metadata, preserving the creation fields and refreshing `Updated at` whenever the artifact is updated,
- do not move or recreate them in subdirectories or alternate paths.

Context to review:

- current branch diff against `main`,
- final current code,
- `FEATURE_SPEC_AND_PLAN.md`, if present,
- `REVIEW.md`,
- `WALKTHROUGH.md`,
- `REVIEW_FIX_VERIFICATION.md`, if present.

Success criteria:

- `REVIEW.md` matches the final code and clearly distinguishes resolved findings from any remaining suggestions,
- `WALKTHROUGH.md` matches the final code state and remains useful for a beginner human reviewer,
- `REVIEW.md` records the final documentation-checkpoint status for every material changed behavior,
- the refreshed artifacts are detailed, grounded, and internally consistent.

Constraints:

- do not modify production code,
- do not modify tests,
- do not make new review findings unless you discover something severe that was missed,
- treat missing, inaccurate, or unvalidated required durable documentation as a severe missed issue; stop and ask rather than finalizing the review artifacts,
- if you discover a severe missed issue, stop and ask before proceeding.

## Required output 1: refreshed `REVIEW.md`

Update `REVIEW.md` in the target repo root so it reflects the final code.

It must include:

- final verdict,
- plan compliance,
- backwards compatibility review,
- public API review,
- performance/complexity review,
- source documentation grounding,
- code quality/readability,
- Python typing review, when applicable,
- reuse/DRY/duplication,
- assumptions surfaced,
- assert usage,
- cross-platform review,
- test review, if applicable,
- documentation review with every material changed behavior's update-and-validation evidence or evidence-based `Not applicable` rationale,
- any remaining suggestions.

Clearly mark review findings that were fixed during the review loop.

## Required output 2: refreshed `WALKTHROUGH.md`

Update `WALKTHROUGH.md` in the target repo root so it reflects the final code, not the old pre-fix code.

Document each change with context, line by line, helping a beginner programmer review the code from scratch without prior context.

Begin with a prose overview of the code under review: entry points, affected files and symbols, dependencies, shared state, and their relationships. Use concrete file and symbol names from inspected code.

Describe every reachable control-flow branch and data/state transition through that code in prose. Identify branch conditions, inputs, calls, side effects, and terminal success or error states. Include early returns, skipped work, exception propagation and handling, retries, and cleanup wherever they exist. Explain loop conditions and exits instead of repeating cycles. Mark paths or outcomes that cannot be verified; do not invent behavior.

Keep diagrams, presentation diffs, and pseudocode out of `WALKTHROUGH.md`; phase `07` presents them in chat from freshly inspected code and PR changes. Preserve source excerpts and prose coverage of relationships and flows here. Do not create HTML or additional visual artifacts.

Group the code into small semantic blocks, each covering one coherent operation or decision. Include relevant surrounding lines and file/line locations. For every variable, constant, parameter, attribute, function, or method referenced but not defined in the displayed block, show its declaration or definition in a separate short excerpt with its file/line location. Show the relevant binding or initialization for values and enough of a called function or method to explain the call. For imported symbols, identify the source and use its verified declaration or definition; never invent one.

Include enough detail for a thorough review without opening the source code.

Every line of code must have an English explanation beside it.

Use short, readable excerpts and keep each explanation beside the code it describes.

The walkthrough must be suitable as a supplement for my human review and potentially as PR-description source material.

Before finishing, verify that `REVIEW.md` and `WALKTHROUGH.md` match the final code state.
